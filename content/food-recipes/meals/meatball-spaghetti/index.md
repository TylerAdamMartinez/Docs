## Instructions

### Meatballs:
1. In a large bowl, combine all the meatball ingredients (ground
 beef, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, milk, egg, minced
 garlic, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper).
2. Mix the ingredients until well combined, but avoid overmixing,
 as it can result in tough meatballs.
3. Shape the mixture into meatballs of your desired size (usually
 about 1-2 inches in diameter). Set them aside.

### Tomato Sauce:
1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic to the pan. Saut√©
 until the onion becomes translucent and the garlic is fragrant.
3. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes, including their juices.
4. Stir in the dried basil, dried oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper.
5. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes,
 stirring occasionally.

### Meatball Assembly:
1. Gently place the meatballs into the simmering tomato sauce.
2. Cover the saucepan and let the meatballs cook in the sauce for about
 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through.
3. Occasionally turn the meatballs to ensure even cooking and coat them with the sauce.

### Spaghetti:
1. While the meatballs are cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
2. Cook the spaghetti noodles according to the package instructions until al dente.
3. Drain the cooked spaghetti and return it to the pot.

### Serving:
1. To serve, divide the cooked spaghetti among serving plates.
2. Top the spaghetti with a generous ladle of tomato sauce and meatballs.
3. Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the top.
4. Garnish with chopped fresh basil, if desired.
5. Serve hot and enjoy!
