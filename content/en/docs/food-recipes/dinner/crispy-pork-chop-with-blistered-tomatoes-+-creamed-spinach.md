## Chef Tip

Tomatoes are a versatile ingredient that adds a lot of flavor to various cuisines. Although considered a fruit botanically, tomatoes are treated as a vegetable in cooking due to their savory taste. When eaten raw, tomatoes showcase their full flavor potential, offering a delightful combination of savory, sweet, and acidic notes.

- 1/2 cup Heavy Cream
- 4 cups Spinach
- 1/4 cup + 1 TBSP Olive Oil (or Avocado)

- 2 Plates
- Cooking Tongs
- Wooden Spoon
- Measuring Cups

## Instructions

1. Tenderize + Bread Pork

   - Place each pork loin chop between two pieces of plastic wrap.
   - Use the back of the skillet to pound the pork loin to approximately 1/2" thickness.
   - Season the pork with salt and pepper.
   - On a plate, combine panko breadcrumbs and half of the Parmesan cheese (reserve the other half for spinach).
   - Press the pork into the breading mixture, ensuring both sides are coated.

2. Pan Fry Pork

   - Heat a large skillet over medium heat with 1/4 cup of oil.
   - Once the oil begins to shimmer (about 2-4 minutes), gently place the breaded pork in the skillet.
   - Cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown and the pork reaches an internal temperature of **145°F**.
   - Transfer the pork to a paper towel-lined plate to rest.

3. Make Tomato + Creamed Spinach

   - While the pork is cooking, heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat with the cherry tomatoes.
   - Once the tomatoes have blistered, reduce the heat to medium and add 1 tablespoon of oil.
   - Stir in the spinach a handful at a time and cook until wilted.
   - Crush the tomatoes with a spoon and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes.
   - Add the cream and the reserved cheese from step 1.
   - Simmer until slightly thickened (about 2-3 minutes).
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. Assemble the Meal

   - Divide the creamed spinach and tomatoes between two plates.
   - Place the pork chop alongside the spinach.
