Perfect as a dip or topping for your favorite Mexican dishes.

## Ingredients

- 2 ripe Hass avocados
- 1/4 cup diced red onion
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely chopped (optional)

## Instructions

1. Cut the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pits. Scoop out the avocado flesh into a mixing bowl.
2. Mash the avocados with a fork until desired consistency is reached (chunky or smooth).
3. Add the diced red onion, chopped cilantro, lime juice, salt, cumin, garlic powder, and jalapeno pepper (if using) to the bowl.
4. Gently mix all the ingredients until well combined.
5. Taste the guacamole and adjust seasoning as needed by adding more salt or lime juice.
6. Transfer the guacamole to a serving bowl.
7. Serve immediately with tortilla chips or as a topping for tacos, burritos, or any other Mexican dish.

## Tips

- For best results, use ripe avocados that are slightly soft to the touch.
- If you prefer a spicier guacamole, leave the jalapeno seeds in or add a pinch of cayenne pepper.
- To prevent the guacamole from browning, place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the guacamole and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Enjoy your homemade guacamole!
